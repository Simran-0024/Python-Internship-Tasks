## **Simple Calculator Program — Documentation**

### **Overview**

I have built a **command-line-based calculator** in Python that takes two numbers and an operator from the user, performs the chosen mathematical operation, and displays the result.
The program supports **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**, including decimal numbers.

---

### **Features**

1. **User-friendly input prompts** for first number, second number, and operator.
2. **Supports decimals** as well as integers by using `float()` for number conversion.
3. **Handles division by zero** with a clear error message.
4. **Handles invalid numeric inputs** using error handling.
5. **Handles invalid operators** and notifies the user if the operator is not supported.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Input Phase**

   * The program asks the user to enter:

     * First number (`a`)
     * Second number (`b`)
     * Operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
   * Numbers are taken as `float` so both integers and decimals can be processed.

2. **Processing Phase**

   * The program checks the entered operator.
   * Based on the operator, it performs:

     * `+` → Addition
     * `-` → Subtraction
     * `*` → Multiplication
     * `/` → Division (with zero-check)
   * If an unsupported operator is entered, it shows **"Invalid operator"**.

3. Error Handling**

   * Division by Zero:** Custom error message — "Cannot divide by zero".
   * Invalid Input: If non-numeric data is entered, it shows — "Please enter valid numeric values."

4. **Output Phase**

   * If a valid operation is performed, the result is displayed to the user.

## **Number Guessing Game — Documentation**

This program is an interactive number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess it within a set number of chances. The game provides hints after each guess, allows early exit by typing `"exit"`, and displays a final message when the game ends.

**Working**

1. **Random Number Generation**

   * At the start of the game, the program generates a random integer between 1 and 100 using Python’s `random` module.
   * This number remains constant for the entire game until the player either guesses correctly or runs out of chances.

2. **User-Defined Chances**

   * The player specifies how many chances they want to have to guess the correct number.
   * The program will loop through these chances one by one.

3. **Guess Input and Exit Option**

   * During each turn, the player is prompted to enter a guess.
   * The player can also type `"exit"` at any point to immediately quit the game.

4. **Input Validation**

   * If the player’s input is not a number or `"exit"`, the program will display an error message and prompt the player again without losing a chance.

5. **Guess Evaluation**

   * If the guess matches the secret number, the program congratulates the player and ends the game early.
   * If the guess is lower than the secret number, a “Too Low” message is displayed.
   * If the guess is higher than the secret number, a “Too High” message is displayed.

6. **End of Game**

   * If the player uses up all their chances without guessing correctly, the program informs them that they have lost and reveals the total number of chances they had.
   * The program ends automatically after displaying the result.

**Key Features**

* Random number generation for unpredictability.
* Player decides the number of chances.
* Exit command (`"exit"`) for immediate termination of the game.
* Error handling for invalid inputs.
* Feedback after each guess to guide the player.

**Example Gameplay Flow**
1. The player chooses 5 chances.
2. The computer picks a random number.
3. The player starts guessing, receiving hints after each attempt.
4. The game ends when the player guesses correctly, runs out of chances, or types `"exit"`.

## **Number System Converter — Documentation**

### **Overview**

The *Number System Converter* is a Python-based, menu-driven application that allows users to convert numbers between **Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal** formats. It provides a simple interactive interface where the user selects the type of conversion, inputs a value, and receives the converted result instantly.

---

### **Objective**

To create a simple and user-friendly tool for converting numbers between different number systems using Python’s built-in functions.

---

### **Tools Used**

* **Python 3.x** — for program logic and built-in conversion functions
* **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook** — for writing and running the code
* **Basic knowledge of number systems** — to understand conversions between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal

---

### **Features**

* Menu-driven interface for easy navigation
* Supports the following conversions:

  1. Decimal → Binary
  2. Binary → Decimal
  3. Decimal → Octal
  4. Octal → Decimal
  5. Decimal → Hexadecimal
  6. Hexadecimal → Decimal
* Repeats until the user chooses to exit
* Uses Python’s built-in functions like `bin()`, `oct()`, `hex()`, and `int()` for accurate conversions

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Menu Display**
   The program displays a list of conversion options (1–6) and an exit option (7).

2. **User Input**
   The user selects the desired conversion type by entering a number from the menu.

3. **Number Entry**
   Based on the selected option, the user is prompted to enter a number in the corresponding number system.

4. **Conversion Process**

   * For decimal to other systems, Python’s `bin()`, `oct()`, and `hex()` functions are used.
   * For other systems to decimal, the `int(number, base)` function is used, where the base is **2** for binary, **8** for octal, and **16** for hexadecimal.

5. **Output**
   The converted number is displayed in the appropriate format (without prefixes like `0b`, `0o`, or `0x`).

6. **Repeat or Exit**
   After each conversion, the menu appears again, allowing the user to perform multiple conversions until they choose to exit.

# Documentation: Student Marks Processing with CSV

## **Objective**

The project demonstrates how to process student academic records stored in a CSV file using Python. It calculates totals and percentages, identifies top performers, flags weak students for a re-test, and stores the results in a new CSV file.

---

## **Input File (students.csv)**

The CSV file contains the following columns:

* **Name** – Student’s name
* **Roll Number** – Unique student identifier
* **Subject1–Subject5** – Marks in 5 subjects

### Example Data:

| Name   | Roll Number | Subject1 | Subject2 | Subject3 | Subject4 | Subject5 |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Aarav  | 101         | 78       | 85       | 69       | 90       | 82       |
| Priya  | 103         | 90       | 88       | 95       | 92       | 85       |
| Aniket | 104         | 35       | 40       | 28       | 50       | 45       |

---

## **Steps Performed**

1. **Reading Data**

   * The program reads the `students.csv` file and extracts student details.
   * It converts marks into integers for calculations.

2. **Calculations**

   * **Total Marks** are computed by summing scores from all 5 subjects.
   * **Percentage** is calculated as:

     $$
     \text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Total Marks}}{5}
     $$

3. **Top Performers**

   * Students are ranked by percentage.
   * The **top 3 students** are displayed on the screen.

4. **Re-Test Identification**

   * Any student with a **percentage below 40%** is flagged for a re-test.

5. **Output File Creation**

   * A new file `results.csv` is generated.
   * It contains: **Name, Roll Number, Total, Percentage, and Result (Pass/Fail)**.

---

## **Expected Results**

### **On Screen Output**

* **Top 3 Performers:**

  1. Priya – 90%
  2. Aarav – 80.8%
  3. Mehak – 61.8%

* **Re-Test Candidates (<40%):**

  * Aniket – 39.6%

* Confirmation message for `results.csv` creation.

---

### **Output File (results.csv)**

| Name   | Roll Number | Total | Percentage | Result |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | ------ |
| Aarav  | 101         | 404   | 80.80      | Pass   |
| Priya  | 103         | 450   | 90.00      | Pass   |
| Aniket | 104         | 198   | 39.60      | Fail   |
| Mehak  | 105         | 309   | 61.80      | Pass   |

---

## **Error Handling**

* **File Not Found:** Displays an error if `students.csv` is missing.
* **Invalid Data:** Skips a record if marks are not valid numbers.
